# veha = VeXeRe Employee Happiness

At VeXeRe, we believe all office workers are deserved to have a happy life at office, where they have been spending half of their life time. That's why we made this app.

At VeXeRe, we feel thankful because of the giving spirit of the open source community, that's why we decided to make this app open-source as well, to pay it back to community. And we are planning to give more and more.

An HR app, app for employee that aims to boost employee happiness, but without being a standard HR functional mobile application.
